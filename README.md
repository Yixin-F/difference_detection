## Compilation

The code is compiled using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and requires [Eigen](eigen.tuxfamily.org). It has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with gcc 5.4.0 and on Windows with Visual Studio 2015. 

Follow the following steps to compile the code:

1) Make sure Eigen is installed. We recommend version 3.3+.
	- Download Eigen from eigen.tuxfamily.org and extract it 
	into a folder 'eigen' within the 'include' folder. Make sure the files 'include/eigen/Eigen/Dense' and 'include/eigen/unsupported/Eigen/MatrixFunctions' can be found 
	- Alternatively: On Ubuntu, use the command "apt-get install libeigen3-dev" to install Eigen. 

2) Create a build folder 'build' within the root directory of the code

3) Run cmake to generate the build files inside the build folder, and compile the source code:
    - On linux, run the following commands within the build folder:
    ```
   $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
   $ make
    ```
    - On windows, use the cmake GUI to generate a visual studio solution file, and build the solution.

4) Afterwards, there should be an exectuable file 'FRICP' generated.

## Usage

The program is run with four input parameters:

1. an input file storing the source point cloud;
2. an input file storing the target point cloud;
3. an output path storing the registered source point cloud and transformation;
4. registration method:
5. search radius (<0.5)
```
0: ICP
1: AA-ICP
2: Ours (Fast ICP)
3: Ours (Robust ICP)
4: ICP Point-to-plane
5: Our (Robust ICP point-to-plane)
6: Sparse ICP
7: Sparse ICP point-to-plane
```
You can ignore the last parameter, in which case `Ours (Robust ICP)` will be used by default. 

Example:
```
$ ./FRICP ./data/target.ply ./data/source.ply ./data/res/ 3 0.2
```
Please adjust the voxelgrid leafsize in read_pcd() and main.cpp
But obj and ply (Non-binary encoding) files are supported.

### Initialization support 
If you have an initial transformation that can be applied on the input source model to roughly align with the input target model, you can set `use_init=true` and set `file_init` to the initial file name in `main.cpp` . The format of the initial transformation is a 4x4 matrix(`[R, t; 0, 1]`), where `R` is a 3x3 rotation matrix and `t` is a 3x1 translation vector. These numbers are stored in 4 rows, and separated by spaces in each row. This format is the same as the output transformation of this code. It is worth mentioning that this code will align the center of gravity of the initial source and target models by default before starting the registration process, but this operation will be no longer used when the initial transformation is provided. In our experiment, we directly use the output file of transformation matrix generated by [Super4PCS](https://github.com/nmellado/Super4PCS) as the initial file.

### Note
If the source model and the target model have a good initial alignment, you can replace the contents (in the lines 63-67 of ``main.cpp``)
```
VectorN source_mean, target_mean;
source_mean = vertices_source.rowwise().sum() / double(vertices_source.cols());
target_mean = vertices_target.rowwise().sum() / double(vertices_target.cols());
vertices_source.colwise() -= source_mean;
vertices_target.colwise() -= target_mean;
```
with
```
VectorN source_mean(0,0,0), target_mean(0,0,0);
```
This modification is more suitable for examples with low overlap rates.
